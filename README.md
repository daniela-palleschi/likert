# likert

Reproducible script for visualising Likert scale data.

These materials were created by Daniela Palleschi.

## Purpose

Guide for students and colleagues to produce barplots and tables to visualise the distribution of/summarise Likert data.

## Data

The data (df_toydata.csv) contains toy data collected during a test run of a 2x2 experiment (heritage: formal, informal; instruments: high, low) with four 7-point Likert scales per trial (tempo, familiarity, formality, formality difference).

## Script

The script should run without any changes (if you are working from within the RProject).
